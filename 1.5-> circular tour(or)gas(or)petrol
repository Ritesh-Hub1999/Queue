Example 1:
---------
Input:
N = 4
Petrol = 4 6 7 4
Distance = 6 5 3 5

Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 petrol pumps with
amount of petrol and distance to next
petrol pump value pairs as {4, 6}, {6, 5},
{7, 3} and {4, 5}. The first point from
where truck can make a circular tour is
2nd petrol pump. Output in this case is 1
(index of 2nd petrol pump)

code:
----
int tour(petrolPump p[],int n)
    {
       int balance=0;
       int kami=0;
       int start=0;
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
           balance=balance+p[i].petrol-p[i].distance;
           if(balance<0){
               kami=kami+balance;
               start=i+1;
               balance=0;
           }
       }
       if(balance + kami >=0){
           return start;
       }
       else{
           return -1;
       }
       
    }
